This repository contains the code for my experimental project conducted as part of my thesis. The project focuses on employing an ensemble approach to word embedding by combining FastText and TF-IDF techniques. 
The dataset used for experimentation is OLID, consisting of three levels: A, B, and C. The FastText model pretrained on "cc.en.300" embeddings is utilized for this experiment.
The objective of this research is to compare the results with the baseline study conducted by Zampieri et al., 2019. 
In their study "Predicting the Type and Target of Offensive Posts in Social Media", Zampieri et al. employed SVM and BiLSTM models using FastText standalone embeddings.
The evaluation metric used for comparison is the F1 macro score. 
Results from this experiment will be compared against the baseline models from Zampieri et al., 2019.
